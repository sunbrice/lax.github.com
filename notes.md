Three rules to make decisions like a boss.

Rule #1: Make quick decisions. It’s better to be 40% of the times wrong than 90% of the times undecided.

Rule #2: Overcome the temptation to stick to yesterday’s wrong decision just to look more consistent. Nobody hired you for consistency, but people will fire you for sticking to wrong decisions.

Rule #3: Accept that other people around you follow rule #1. If smart people reject your idea, it doesn’t mean it’s a bad idea.
