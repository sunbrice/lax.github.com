I can still remember the time, when I spent a whole day download<br>Fedora Core 5 install images from redhat official website.<br>I have tried several Linux versions on my Dell laptop. The original<br>installed Microsoft Windows XP make no means to me as I can&#39;t arrange<br>many system services on it. So I find several Linux distributions like<br>Mandrake, Suse, in the FTP site of campus, and burn them into CDs. But<br>I think they are too old not because there relatively long history,<br>but there missing function: non of them can drive my network device,<br>though I must say Suse shows an excellent appearance.<br>Then Fedora Cora 5 did it. I can connect to the internet and find<br>answers to various of problems and questions, that&#39;s fabulous. At that<br>time I was not familiar with Linux style enough to solve some of the<br>problems.<br>Soon Fedora Core 6 come out with the ability to recognize my sound<br>card. It is a WOW! experience because FC6 added several features which<br>make it an perfect Desktop environment. I learned linux style<br>opereation on FC6, server my computer as an mini http&amp;ftp server, they<br>are all so exciting for a beginner as me.<br>Months later I have knowledge of Fedora Development project, which add<br>the newest packages to Fedora to form a new version at the end. I<br>joined the group and began the excellent experience.<br>I would say: Linux is funny, and Open Source softwares will do<br>everything perfect, better than most of other known operating systems.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4666702678549991852-964692941164334209?l=liulantao.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
