Help--&gt;Software Updates --&gt; Find and Install....<br>
then in the pop - up window which appears ,..<br>
Search for new features to install<br>
and then click next and then u will have to add 2 new remote sites, .. the details for the sites are the ones which were very difficult to obtain , they are<br> 
site 1 :<br>
Name :RadRails<br>
URL : http://radrails.sourceforge.net/update<br>
site 2 :<br>
