<div style="text-align: center;"><b>Principles behind the Agile Manifesto</b><br><br><br>We follow these principles:<br><br>Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer<br>through early and continuous delivery<br>of valuable software.<br> <br>Welcome changing requirements, even late in<br>development. Agile processes harness change for<br>the customer&#39;s competitive advantage.<br><br>Deliver working software frequently, from a<br>couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a<br> preference to the shorter timescale.<br><br>Business people and developers must work<br>together daily throughout the project.<br><br>Build projects around motivated individuals.<br>Give them the environment and support they need,<br> and trust them to get the job done.<br><br>The most efficient and effective method of<br>conveying information to and within a development<br>team is face-to-face conversation.<br><br>Working software is the primary measure of progress.<br> <br>Agile processes promote sustainable development.<br>The sponsors, developers, and users should be able<br>to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.<br><br>Continuous attention to technical excellence<br>and good design enhances agility.<br> <br>Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount<br>of work not done--is essential.<br><br>The best architectures, requirements, and designs<br>emerge from self-organizing teams.<br><br>At regular intervals, the team reflects on how<br> to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts<br>its behavior accordingly. <br clear="all"></div><br>-- <br>Liu Lantao<br>College of Information Science and Technology, Beijing Normal University<br>EMAIL: liulantao ( at ) gmail ( dot ) com ; <br> WEBSITE: <a href="http://www.liulantao.com/">http://www.liulantao.com/</a> .<br>------<br> <div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4666702678549991852-5513500096263419137?l=liulantao.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
