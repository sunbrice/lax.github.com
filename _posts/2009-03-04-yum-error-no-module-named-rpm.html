When I am upgrading my Fedora 10 to Fedora rawhide, my desktop was locked. Then I restart the computer, rerun the yum upgrade. some error like the following comes out.<br>-------------------------<br>There was a problem importing one of the Python modules<br>  required to run yum. The error leading to this problem was:<br> <br>    No module named rpm<br> <br> Please install a package which provides this module, or<br> verify that the module is installed correctly.<br> <br> It&#39;s possible that the above module doesn&#39;t match the<br> current version of Python, which is:<br> 2.5 (r25:51908, Apr 10 2007, 10:29:13)<br> [GCC 4.1.2 20070403 (Red Hat 4.1.2-8)]<br> <br> If you cannot solve this problem yourself, please go to<br> the yum faq at:<br>   <a href="http://wiki.linux.duke.edu/YumFaq" target="_blank">http://wiki.linux.duke.edu/YumFaq</a><br>-------------------------<br clear="all">someone in fedoraforum said to reinstall yum and python, but i found it didn&#39;t work well.<br> <br>then i try uninstall some yum plugin such as yum-metadata-parser, then the error mesage becomes<br>--------------<br>    No module named iniparser<br>--------------<br>it seems that the error comes from here.<br>then i find a package called python-iniparser is out of date. so i download it by hand and update it.<br>try to yum upgrade again, it works! everything comes to there original way.<br> <br>after all, you just need to reinstall 2 packages: yum-metadata-parser and python-iniparser.<br><br>-- <br>Liu Lantao<br>College of Information Science and Technology, Beijing Normal University<br>EMAIL: liulantao ( at ) gmail ( dot ) com ; <br> WEBSITE: <a href="http://www.liulantao.com/">http://www.liulantao.com/</a> .<br>------<br> <div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/6152326-3064007360935786036?l=lltaichi.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
