点评：本周语录充满了各种各样的牢骚和抱怨，难道这是开发者们刚休完年假的普遍心态？

*    Alan Cox
     
     > I'm leaving the Linux world and Intel for a bit for family reasons. I'm aware that "family reasons" is usually management speak for "I think the boss is an asshole" but I'd like to assure everyone that while I frequently think Linus is an asshole (and therefore very good as kernel dictator) I am departing quite genuinely for family reasons and not because I've fallen out with Linus or Intel or anyone else.


*    Steven Rostedt
     
     > Yes, it's very unlikely, but we are in the business of dealing with the very unlikely. That's because in our business, the very unlikely is very likely. Damn, I need to buy a lotto ticket!


*    Tom St Denis
     
     > About the only thing Kernel developers agree on is they use C and don't comment their code.


*    Arnd Bergmann
     
     > Documentation is generally considered a good thing, but few people can be bothered to write it, and few of the other people that should read it actually do.
