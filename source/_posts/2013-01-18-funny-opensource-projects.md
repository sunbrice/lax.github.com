# [Octopress](https://github.com/imathis/octopress)

这是又一个基于jekyll的博客程序，类似Jekyll-Bootstrap。和JB相比，默认界面风格更有传统blog系统的韵味，对于代码的支持也宣称做的更好，实在是众多码农码神的利器。

 Octopress is Jekyll blogging at its finest.

 *    Octopress sports a clean responsive theme written in semantic HTML5, focused on readability and friendliness toward mobile devices.
 *    Code blogging is easy and beautiful. Embed code (with Solarized styling) in your posts from gists, jsFiddle or from your filesystem.
 *    Third party integration is simple with built-in support for Twitter, Pinboard, Delicious, GitHub Repositories, Disqus Comments and Google Analytics.
 *    It's easy to use. A collection of rake tasks simplifies development and makes deploying a cinch.
 *    Ships with great plug-ins some original and others from the Jekyll community — tested and improved.

# [ktap](https://github.com/ktap/ktap)

与DTrace、SystemTap类似的追踪程序，用于对系统和程序的调用栈进行追踪调试。目前这个软件还在开发的初始阶段。
